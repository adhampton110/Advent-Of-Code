# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of programming challenges that take place in December each year. Created by Eric Wastl, these challenges are a fun way for programmers to improve their coding skills and solve problems.

Every day in December, a new challenge is released on the Advent of Code website. Each challenge consists of two parts, with the second part being unlocked only after the first one is completed. The challenges are designed to be self-contained and can be solved in any programming language.

# Repository

This repository contains a collection of completed Advent of Code challenges. Each file in this repository corresponds to a single challenge and includes both the problem statement and the solution code.

These files are named according to the day of the challenge, for example, "day1.py" corresponds to the first challenge of Advent of Code.
